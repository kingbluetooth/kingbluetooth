- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Harald Bluetooth, king of Denmark and Norway in the 10th century.
- I unified Denmark, brought Christianity to my people, and strengthened my kingdom through alliances and warfare.
- My legacy endures as a symbol of connection and unity, much like the Bluetooth technology named after me today.
